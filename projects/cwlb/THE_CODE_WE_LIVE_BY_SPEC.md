# The Code We Live By (CWLB) - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

**The Code We Live By** (CWLB) is a civic engagement platform that makes federal legislation accessible and understandable by treating the US Code as a software repository. By leveraging the familiar metaphors of version control (commits, pull requests, diffs, contributors), the platform enables citizens to explore how laws evolve over time, understand congressional activity patterns, and gain insights into the legislative process.

**Brand**: The Code We Live By | **Acronym**: CWLB | **Social**: @cwlb

**Mission**: Increase transparency and public understanding of how the nation's laws are created, modified, and maintained.

## 1. Core Concept & Metaphor Mapping

### Repository Metaphor

| US Code Concept | Software Repository Equivalent |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| US Code (current state) | Repository main branch |
| Individual sections (e.g., 17 USC § 106) | Source code files |
| Public Law / Statute | Merged Pull Request (PR) |
| Proposed bill | Open Pull Request |
| Failed/rejected bill | Closed/Rejected PR |
| Bill sponsor(s) | PR Author(s) |
| Co-sponsors | Co-authors |
| Congress members who voted | Reviewers |
| President's signature | Final approval/merge |
| Presidential veto | PR rejection |
| Veto override | Forced merge |
| Amendment to bill during passage | Commits to PR branch |
| Effective date | Merge timestamp |
| Historical versions of code | Git history / time travel |
| Titles (e.g., Title 17) | Repository directories/modules |
| Congressional debates/hearings | PR conversation/comments |
| Cross-references between sections | Code dependencies |

### Understanding the US Code Structure

The United States Code is the codification of federal statutory law, organized in a hierarchical structure:

**Structural Levels:**

1. **Titles** (54 total) - Broad subject areas
   - Example: Title 17 (Copyright), Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code)
   - Each title covers a major legal domain

2. **Chapters** - Major subdivisions within a title
   - Example: Title 17, Chapter 1 (Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright)
   - Typically 10-50+ chapters per title

3. **Sections** - The fundamental unit of law, indicated by the § symbol
   - Example: 17 USC § 106 (Exclusive rights in copyrighted works)
   - Full citation format: `[Title] USC § [Section]`
   - Most legislative changes happen at the section level
   - Typically hundreds to thousands of sections per title

4. **Subsections** - Numbered or lettered subdivisions within a section
   - Example: § 106(1), § 106(2), or § 106(a), § 106(b)
   - Contains the detailed provisions of the law

5. **Paragraphs, Subparagraphs, Clauses, Subclauses** - Deeper nesting
   - Example: § 101(a)(1)(A)(i)
   - Can nest several levels deep for complex provisions

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Title 17 - Copyright
├── Chapter 1 - Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
│   ├── § 101 - Definitions
│   ├── § 102 - Subject matter of copyright: In general
│   │   ├── (a) Copyright protection subsists...
│   │   └── (b) In no case does copyright protection...
│   ├── § 106 - Exclusive rights in copyrighted works
│   │   ├── (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work...
│   │   ├── (2) to prepare derivative works...
│   │   └── (6) in the case of sound recordings...
│   └── § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
├── Chapter 2 - Copyright Ownership and Transfer
│   └── ...
└── Chapter 13 - Protection of Original Designs
    └── ...
```

### Repository Structure Mapping

After evaluating multiple structural approaches (see [Appendix D](#appendix-d-alternative-repository-structure-mappings) for alternatives), we recommend **Section-as-File** mapping:

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01-Subject-Matter-and-Scope/
│   │   ├── Section-101-Definitions.md
│   │   ├── Section-102-Subject-Matter-In-General.md
│   │   ├── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
│   │   └── Section-107-Fair-Use.md
│   ├── Chapter-02-Copyright-Ownership/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── README.md (Title overview)
├── Title-26-Internal-Revenue-Code/
│   └── ...
└── README.md (US Code overview)
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Top-level directories/modules
- **Chapters** → Subdirectories
- **Sections** → Individual files (e.g., `Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md`)
- **Subsections** → Content within files (with anchor links for deep linking)
- **Paragraphs/clauses** → Nested content within files

**Example PR (Law) changing 3 sections:**
```
PL 105-304: Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Files changed: 3

Modified:
  ✏️ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-01/Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
  ✏️ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-05/Section-512-Limitations-on-Liability.md
Added:
  ➕ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-12/Section-1201-Circumvention-of-Tech-Measures.md
```

### Why Section-as-File?

1. **Matches legislative practice**: The section is the fundamental unit that Congress modifies (~80% of laws operate at this level)
2. **Optimal diff readability**: Typical laws modify 5-30 sections, producing clean "Files changed" lists
3. **Legal citation alignment**: "17 USC § 106" maps directly to a file path
4. **Scalability**: ~60,000 sections is manageable for modern systems
5. **Historical clarity**: Each section's evolution is tracked independently
6. **Balanced granularity**: Not too coarse (chapters) or too fine (subsections)

**Implementation notes:**
- File naming: Use descriptive names like `Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md` rather than just `106.md` for better discoverability
- Internal structure: Use markdown headers for subsections to enable deep linking
- Metadata: Include frontmatter with section number, heading, enactment date, last modified
- Cross-references: Automatically hyperlink citations to other sections (e.g., "section 107" → link to Section-107 file)

---

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary**: General public interested in civic engagement, transparency, and understanding government

**Characteristics**:
- May not have legal training
- Interested in understanding "how the sausage is made"
- Want to answer questions about legislative patterns and trends
- Value transparency and accessibility

**Design Principle**: Progressive disclosure - simple and accessible by default, with depth available for those who want it.

---

## 3. Phase 1 Scope

### Coverage
- **Titles**: 5-10 most publicly relevant titles, including:
  - Title 10: Armed Forces
  - Title 17: Copyright
  - Title 18: Crimes and Criminal Procedure
  - Title 20: Education
  - Title 22: Foreign Relations and Intercourse
  - Title 26: Internal Revenue Code (Tax)
  - Title 42: Public Health and Social Welfare
  - Title 50: War and National Defense
  - Additional titles based on public interest and data availability

### Historical Depth
- **Full legislative history** from original enactment to present
- Acknowledges that older records may require additional research/digitization effort

### Geographic Scope
- Federal law only (US Code)
- State laws excluded from Phase 1

**Why parent/child tree structure?**
- Handles arbitrary nesting depth (US Code can nest 5+ levels deep)
- Natural representation of legal document structure
- Enables precise blame attribution at line level
- Supports deep linking to any sentence or list item
- Simplifies queries for subtree navigation and context display

**Line Types:**
- **Heading**: Any level of heading (section title, subsection header, paragraph label)
- **Prose**: Regular paragraph text
- **ListItem**: Any enumerated item at any nesting level

The tree structure emerges from `parent_line_id`, eliminating the need for fixed "SubsectionHeading" types.

**Example: [17 USC § 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106)**

| line_id | parent_id | line_# | type | path | depth | text_content |
|---------|-----------|--------|------|------|-------|--------------|
| 100 | NULL | 1 | Heading | NULL | 0 | § 106. Exclusive rights in copyrighted works |
| 101 | 100 | 2 | Prose | NULL | 1 | Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following: |
| 102 | 101 | 3 | ListItem | "(1)" | 2 | to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; |
| 103 | 101 | 4 | ListItem | "(2)" | 2 | to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; |
| 104 | 101 | 5 | ListItem | "(3)" | 2 | to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public... |

**LineHistory** (Historical versions of lines)
- `line_history_id`: Primary key
- `line_id`: Foreign key to USCodeLine
- `version_number`: Integer (1, 2, 3... for each time this line changed)
- `text_content`: Text (historical text at this version)
- `modified_by_law_id`: Foreign key to PublicLaw
- `effective_date`: Date
- `parent_line_id`: Foreign key (parent at this version, may differ from current)

**Key Query Patterns:**

```sql
-- Get all lines in a section (ordered for display)
SELECT * FROM USCodeLine
WHERE section_id = ?
ORDER BY line_number;

-- Get direct children of a line
SELECT * FROM USCodeLine
WHERE parent_line_id = ?
ORDER BY line_number;

-- Get entire subtree (recursive CTE)
WITH RECURSIVE subtree AS (
  SELECT * FROM USCodeLine WHERE line_id = ?
  UNION ALL
  SELECT l.* FROM USCodeLine l
  JOIN subtree s ON l.parent_line_id = s.line_id
)
SELECT * FROM subtree ORDER BY line_number;

-- Get path to root (breadcrumb trail)
WITH RECURSIVE path AS (
  SELECT * FROM USCodeLine WHERE line_id = ?
  UNION ALL
  SELECT l.* FROM USCodeLine l
  JOIN path p ON l.line_id = p.parent_line_id
)
SELECT * FROM path ORDER BY depth_level;

-- Blame view: lines with law attribution
SELECT l.line_number, l.text_content, l.subsection_path,
       pl.law_number, pl.popular_name, pl.enacted_date, pl.president,
       c.congress
FROM USCodeLine l
JOIN PublicLaw pl ON l.last_modified_by_law_id = pl.law_id
WHERE l.section_id = ?
ORDER BY l.line_number;
```

## 7. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React or Next.js for interactive UI
- **Visualization**: D3.js or Observable for charts and graphs
- **Diff Display**: react-diff-viewer or custom diff component
- **Routing**: Support deep linking to sections, laws, time periods
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for complex state

### Backend
- **API**: RESTful or GraphQL API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, with full-text search
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed sections/laws
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced full-text search

### Data Pipeline
- **Sources**:
  - US House Office of Law Revision Counsel (official US Code source)
  - GovInfo API (GPO - Government Publishing Office)
  - Congress.gov API
  - ProPublica Congress API (for legislator data)
  - Historical sources for pre-digital records

- **ETL Process**:
  - Ingest Public Laws in structured format (XML/JSON)
  - Parse legal language to extract section changes
  - **Parse sections into USCodeLine tree structure**:
    - Identify headings, prose, and list items
    - Build parent/child relationships based on legal nesting
    - Extract subsection paths (e.g., "(c)(1)(A)(ii)")
    - Compute depth levels for rendering
    - Calculate line hashes for change detection
  - Build historical versions by applying changes chronologically
  - Track line-level attribution (created_by, last_modified_by)
  - Link legislators to sponsorship and votes

- **Challenges**:
  - Older laws may be in PDF/scanned format requiring OCR
  - Legal language parsing is complex (e.g., "Section 106 is amended by striking 'and' and inserting 'or'")
  - **Line parsing complexity**: Determining boundaries between lines (sentence vs. clause vs. list item)
  - **Tree structure inference**: Legal documents don't explicitly mark parent/child relationships
  - Effective dates may differ from enactment dates
  - Scale: Millions of USCodeLine records across ~60,000 sections

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- **CDN**: For static assets and performance
- **Authentication**: Optional user accounts for saved searches, annotations

## 8. User Interface & Experience

### Key Principles
1. **Clarity over complexity**: Use plain language, avoid legal jargon where possible
2. **Progressive disclosure**: Show essentials first, details on demand
3. **Visual hierarchy**: Use familiar GitHub-style UI patterns where applicable
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, screen reader friendly

### Main Navigation
- **Explore Code**: Browse current US Code structure
- **View Laws**: Search and browse individual laws (PRs)
- **Analytics**: Dashboard for insights and trends
- **About**: Educational content, methodology, data sources

## 13. Technical Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge: Parsing Legal Language
Legal statutes often describe changes indirectly:
> "Section 106 is amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following..."

**Mitigation**:
- Use Office of Law Revision Counsel's XML format (structured amendments)
- Build parser for common amendment patterns
- Manual review for complex cases
- Display both original bill language AND resulting code change

### Challenge: Line-Level Parsing and Tree Structure
Breaking sections into individual lines with parent/child relationships requires sophisticated parsing that doesn't exist in source documents.

**Specific Challenges**:
- **Line boundaries**: What constitutes a "line"? Is "Subject to sections 107 through 122..." one line or multiple?
- **Nested list detection**: Recognizing that "(A)(i)" is a child of "(A)" which is a child of "(1)"
- **Prose vs. list items**: When a paragraph introduces a list with a colon, establishing the parent relationship
- **Multi-paragraph items**: Some list items span multiple paragraphs with complex internal structure
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Not all sections follow the same structural conventions
- **Subsection path extraction**: Parsing "(c)(1)(A)(ii)" from various formats

**Mitigation**:
- **Leverage XML structure**: Office of Law Revision Counsel provides XML with some hierarchical hints
- **Pattern recognition**: Build parser that recognizes common patterns:
  - Lines ending with ":" typically parent the following list
  - Numbered/lettered items are children of preceding prose
  - Indentation in source often indicates nesting depth
- **Heuristic rules**:
  - Complete sentences = Prose lines
  - Numbered items at same level = siblings
  - Items with deeper nesting = children
- **Manual correction interface**: Flag ambiguous cases for human review during ETL
- **Iterative refinement**: Parse simple sections first (like § 106), use as training data
- **Version control parsing rules**: Track parser logic changes to enable re-parsing if rules improve
- **Hash-based change detection**: Use line hashes to detect when text hasn't changed across versions

**Example parsing decision tree**:
```
Input: "(1) In general. A service provider shall not be liable..."

Decision:
- Starts with "(1)" → ListItem type
- Contains period after "general" → Has heading component
- Text after period is prose → Could split or keep together
- Decision: Keep as single ListItem with path "(1)"
- Create child Prose line for the text after "In general."
```

### Challenge: Historical Data Availability
Pre-1990s laws may lack structured digital format.

**Mitigation**:
- Partner with legal tech companies or academic institutions
- Phased approach: recent history first, backfill over time
- OCR and manual correction for critical historical laws
- Community contribution model for digitization

### Challenge: Effective Dates vs Enactment Dates
Some laws take effect immediately; others have delayed effective dates or phase-in periods.

**Mitigation**:
- Track both enactment and effective dates
- Time travel defaults to effective date
- Show annotation if dates differ significantly

### Challenge: Scale
Full US Code is ~60,000 sections; with line-level granularity = **millions of USCodeLine records**. With 100+ years of history, LineHistory table could contain tens of millions of records.

**Specific Scale Concerns**:
- Average section has 20-50 lines → 1.2M - 3M current USCodeLine records
- Each line may have 5-10 historical versions → 10M - 30M LineHistory records
- Blame queries joining lines to laws across large datasets
- Deep tree traversals (recursive CTEs) for nested sections
- Full-text search across millions of line records

**Mitigation**:
- **Database optimization**:
  - Efficient indexing on section_id, parent_line_id, line_number
  - Materialized views for common queries (e.g., current section with all lines)
  - Partition LineHistory table by date ranges
  - Use PostgreSQL's recursive CTE optimization
- **Query strategies**:
  - Lazy loading: Load section headings first, expand on demand
  - Pagination for blame view (show first 100 lines)
  - Cache entire sections with line trees in Redis
  - Pre-compute depth_level and subsection_path during ETL
- **Storage optimization**:
  - Compress historical text (many lines unchanged across versions)
  - Use line hashes to detect duplicates
  - Archive very old versions to cold storage
- **CDN**: Serve pre-rendered section HTML for common sections
- **Horizontal scaling**: Partition database by Title for read replicas

### Challenge: Legal Accuracy
Displaying legal text requires precision; errors could mislead users.

**Mitigation**:
- Canonical source: Official US Code from House OLC
- Regular synchronization with official sources
- Clear disclaimers about unofficial nature
- Feedback mechanism for reporting errors

## 14. Open Questions for Further Discussion

1. **Monetization**: Should this be:
   - Fully free (grant-funded or nonprofit)
   - Freemium (advanced features require subscription)
   - Ad-supported (with ethical ad standards)

2. **Governance**: Who maintains this? Options:
   - Nonprofit organization
   - Open-source community
   - Academic institution
   - Government partnership

3. **Amendments to Bills**: Should we show:
   - Amendments proposed during bill passage as "commits to PR branch"?
   - Failed amendments as "rejected commits"?

4. **Cross-References**: How deeply should we link related sections?
   - Inline links to other sections mentioned?
   - Auto-detect citations and hyperlink them?

5. **International Expansion**: Could this model extend to other countries' legal codes?

6. **Educational Materials**: Should we create:
   - Video tutorials?
   - Guided tours (e.g., "The journey of the ADA")?
   - Curriculum for high school civics classes?

## 16. Conclusion

**The Code We Live By** (CWLB) transforms how citizens understand and engage with federal law. By applying the familiar metaphor of software development to the legislative process, we make the US Code accessible, explorable, and analytically rich.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Transparency**: See exactly what changed, when, and by whom
- **Historical Depth**: Time-travel through decades of legal evolution
- **Analytical Power**: Answer questions about legislative patterns and productivity
- **Civic Engagement**: Empower citizens to understand the laws that govern them
- **Familiarity**: Leverage intuitive software development metaphors

This platform has the potential to become an essential tool for civic education, journalism, legal research, and public understanding of government.

- Open data license for all content

## Appendix D: Alternative Repository Structure Mappings

This appendix presents alternative approaches to mapping the US Code structure to repository files. The main specification recommends **Section-as-File** (see Section 1), but these alternatives were considered during design.

### Option 2: Chapter-as-File

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01-Subject-Matter-and-Scope.md
│   ├── Chapter-02-Copyright-Ownership.md
│   └── Chapter-13-Original-Designs.md
├── Title-26-Internal-Revenue-Code/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Directories
- **Chapters** → Files
- **Sections** → Major headings within files
- **Subsections** → Content under headings

**Pros:**
- Fewer total files (~500-1000 vs ~60,000)
- Easier to browse at high level
- Simpler file tree navigation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Very large files (some chapters have 100+ sections)
- ❌ Diffs are harder to read (entire chapter shows as changed even for 1-section amendments)
- ❌ Doesn't match legislative granularity (laws rarely touch whole chapters)
- ❌ Harder to link to specific provisions
- ❌ Section-level history is obscured

**Verdict**: Too coarse-grained for the use case. Would make diffs unwieldy and obscure the section-level changes that are fundamental to legislation.

---

### Option 3: Subsection-as-File

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01/
│   │   ├── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights/
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-1-Reproduction.md
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-2-Derivative-Works.md
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-3-Distribution.md
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── Section-107-Fair-Use/
│   │       └── ...
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Top-level directories
- **Chapters** → Directories
- **Sections** → Directories
- **Subsections** → Files
- **Paragraphs** → Content within files

**Pros:**
- Maximum granularity for tracking changes
- Very precise change attribution

**Cons:**
- ❌ Hundreds of thousands of files (overwhelming)
- ❌ Too granular for most use cases
- ❌ Many laws modify entire sections, not subsections
- ❌ Navigation becomes cumbersome
- ❌ Doesn't match typical legislative or legal citation patterns

**Verdict**: Too fine-grained. Creates an overwhelming number of files and doesn't match how laws are typically cited or modified.

### Option 4: Hybrid Section-as-File with Subsection Anchors

**Structure:**
Same as recommended Section-as-File approach, but with enhanced deep linking:

```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   └── Chapter-01/
│       └── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
```

**File content with anchors:**
```markdown
# § 106 · Exclusive rights in copyrighted works

Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

## (1) Reproduction {#subsection-1}
to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

## (2) Derivative Works {#subsection-2}
to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

...
```

**Enhanced features:**
- URLs can deep-link to subsections: `/Title-17/Chapter-01/Section-106#subsection-2`
- Diffs can highlight subsection-level changes within the file
- UI can show subsection-level change indicators
- Search can index and return subsections as results

**Pros:**
- ✅ Same benefits as Section-as-File
- ✅ Plus: subsection-level precision when needed
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: show section, expand to subsections
- ✅ Flexible for both coarse and fine-grained analysis

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex implementation
- Requires anchor/bookmark parsing

**Verdict**: Strong alternative that could be adopted in Phase 2 for enhanced functionality. Maintains the benefits of Section-as-File while adding subsection-level precision through anchors rather than file structure.
