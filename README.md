# The Code We Live By (CWLB)

A civic engagement platform that makes federal legislation accessible and understandable by treating the US Code as a software repository.

## Vision

Using familiar version control metaphors (commits, pull requests, diffs, blame view), CWLB enables citizens to:
- Explore how laws evolve over time
- See exactly what changed, when, and by whom
- Understand congressional activity patterns
- Gain insights into the legislative process

## Documentation

- [Full Specification](THE_CODE_WE_LIVE_BY_SPEC.md) - Complete product specification
- [Tasks](TASKS.md) - Implementation backlog (Phase 0-3)
- [Research](research/) - Completed research and design documents

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

## Status

Currently in **Phase 0: Research & Validation**

See [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) for current progress.
