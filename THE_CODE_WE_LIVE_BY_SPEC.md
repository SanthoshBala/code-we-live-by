# The Code We Live By (CWLB) - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

**The Code We Live By** (CWLB) is a civic engagement platform that makes federal legislation accessible and understandable by treating the US Code as a software repository. By leveraging the familiar metaphors of version control (commits, pull requests, diffs, contributors), the platform enables citizens to explore how laws evolve over time, understand congressional activity patterns, and gain insights into the legislative process.

**Brand**: The Code We Live By | **Acronym**: CWLB | **Social**: @cwlb

**Mission**: Increase transparency and public understanding of how the nation's laws are created, modified, and maintained.

## 1. Core Concept & Metaphor Mapping

### Repository Metaphor

| US Code Concept | Software Repository Equivalent |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| US Code (current state) | Repository main branch |
| Individual sections (e.g., 17 USC § 106) | Source code files |
| Public Law / Statute | Merged Pull Request (PR) |
| Proposed bill | Open Pull Request |
| Failed/rejected bill | Closed/Rejected PR |
| Bill sponsor(s) | PR Author(s) |
| Co-sponsors | Co-authors |
| Congress members who voted | Reviewers |
| President's signature | Final approval/merge |
| Presidential veto | PR rejection |
| Veto override | Forced merge |
| Amendment to bill during passage | Commits to PR branch |
| Effective date | Merge timestamp |
| Historical versions of code | Git history / time travel |
| Titles (e.g., Title 17) | Repository directories/modules |
| Congressional debates/hearings | PR conversation/comments |
| Cross-references between sections | Code dependencies |

### Understanding the US Code Structure

The United States Code is the codification of federal statutory law, organized in a hierarchical structure:

**Structural Levels:**

1. **Titles** (54 total) - Broad subject areas
   - Example: Title 17 (Copyright), Title 26 (Internal Revenue Code)
   - Each title covers a major legal domain

2. **Chapters** - Major subdivisions within a title
   - Example: Title 17, Chapter 1 (Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright)
   - Typically 10-50+ chapters per title

3. **Sections** - The fundamental unit of law, indicated by the § symbol
   - Example: 17 USC § 106 (Exclusive rights in copyrighted works)
   - Full citation format: `[Title] USC § [Section]`
   - Most legislative changes happen at the section level
   - Typically hundreds to thousands of sections per title

4. **Subsections** - Numbered or lettered subdivisions within a section
   - Example: § 106(1), § 106(2), or § 106(a), § 106(b)
   - Contains the detailed provisions of the law

5. **Paragraphs, Subparagraphs, Clauses, Subclauses** - Deeper nesting
   - Example: § 101(a)(1)(A)(i)
   - Can nest several levels deep for complex provisions

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Title 17 - Copyright
├── Chapter 1 - Subject Matter and Scope of Copyright
│   ├── § 101 - Definitions
│   ├── § 102 - Subject matter of copyright: In general
│   │   ├── (a) Copyright protection subsists...
│   │   └── (b) In no case does copyright protection...
│   ├── § 106 - Exclusive rights in copyrighted works
│   │   ├── (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work...
│   │   ├── (2) to prepare derivative works...
│   │   └── (6) in the case of sound recordings...
│   └── § 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
├── Chapter 2 - Copyright Ownership and Transfer
│   └── ...
└── Chapter 13 - Protection of Original Designs
    └── ...
```

### Repository Structure Mapping

After evaluating multiple structural approaches (see [Appendix D](#appendix-d-alternative-repository-structure-mappings) for alternatives), we recommend **Section-as-File** mapping:

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01-Subject-Matter-and-Scope/
│   │   ├── Section-101-Definitions.md
│   │   ├── Section-102-Subject-Matter-In-General.md
│   │   ├── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
│   │   └── Section-107-Fair-Use.md
│   ├── Chapter-02-Copyright-Ownership/
│   │   └── ...
│   └── README.md (Title overview)
├── Title-26-Internal-Revenue-Code/
│   └── ...
└── README.md (US Code overview)
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Top-level directories/modules
- **Chapters** → Subdirectories
- **Sections** → Individual files (e.g., `Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md`)
- **Subsections** → Content within files (with anchor links for deep linking)
- **Paragraphs/clauses** → Nested content within files

**Example PR (Law) changing 3 sections:**
```
PL 105-304: Digital Millennium Copyright Act
Files changed: 3

Modified:
  ✏️ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-01/Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
  ✏️ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-05/Section-512-Limitations-on-Liability.md
Added:
  ➕ Title-17-Copyright/Chapter-12/Section-1201-Circumvention-of-Tech-Measures.md
```

### Why Section-as-File?

1. **Matches legislative practice**: The section is the fundamental unit that Congress modifies (~80% of laws operate at this level)
2. **Optimal diff readability**: Typical laws modify 5-30 sections, producing clean "Files changed" lists
3. **Legal citation alignment**: "17 USC § 106" maps directly to a file path
4. **Scalability**: ~60,000 sections is manageable for modern systems
5. **Historical clarity**: Each section's evolution is tracked independently
6. **Balanced granularity**: Not too coarse (chapters) or too fine (subsections)

**Implementation notes:**
- File naming: Use descriptive names like `Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md` rather than just `106.md` for better discoverability
- Internal structure: Use markdown headers for subsections to enable deep linking
- Metadata: Include frontmatter with section number, heading, enactment date, last modified
- Cross-references: Automatically hyperlink citations to other sections (e.g., "section 107" → link to Section-107 file)

---

## 2. Target Audience

**Primary**: General public interested in civic engagement, transparency, and understanding government

**Characteristics**:
- May not have legal training
- Interested in understanding "how the sausage is made"
- Want to answer questions about legislative patterns and trends
- Value transparency and accessibility

**Design Principle**: Progressive disclosure - simple and accessible by default, with depth available for those who want it.

---

## 3. Phase 1 Scope

### Coverage
- **Titles**: 5-10 most publicly relevant titles, including:
  - Title 10: Armed Forces
  - Title 17: Copyright
  - Title 18: Crimes and Criminal Procedure
  - Title 20: Education
  - Title 22: Foreign Relations and Intercourse
  - Title 26: Internal Revenue Code (Tax)
  - Title 42: Public Health and Social Welfare
  - Title 50: War and National Defense
  - Additional titles based on public interest and data availability

### Historical Depth
- **Full legislative history** from original enactment to present
- Acknowledges that older records may require additional research/digitization effort

### Geographic Scope
- Federal law only (US Code)
- State laws excluded from Phase 1

**Alternative/Optimization**: Instead of storing line-by-line attribution, could compute blame dynamically by:
1. Starting with section's original enactment law
2. Applying LawChange records chronologically
3. Tracking which law last touched each portion of text
This approach saves storage but increases computation time for blame views.

## 7. Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React or Next.js for interactive UI
- **Visualization**: D3.js or Observable for charts and graphs
- **Diff Display**: react-diff-viewer or custom diff component
- **Routing**: Support deep linking to sections, laws, time periods
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for complex state

### Backend
- **API**: RESTful or GraphQL API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, with full-text search
- **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed sections/laws
- **Search**: Elasticsearch for advanced full-text search

### Data Pipeline
- **Sources**:
  - US House Office of Law Revision Counsel (official US Code source)
  - GovInfo API (GPO - Government Publishing Office)
  - Congress.gov API
  - ProPublica Congress API (for legislator data)
  - Historical sources for pre-digital records

- **ETL Process**:
  - Ingest Public Laws in structured format (XML/JSON)
  - Parse legal language to extract section changes
  - Build historical versions by applying changes chronologically
  - Link legislators to sponsorship and votes

- **Challenges**:
  - Older laws may be in PDF/scanned format requiring OCR
  - Legal language parsing is complex (e.g., "Section 106 is amended by striking 'and' and inserting 'or'")
  - Effective dates may differ from enactment dates

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- **CDN**: For static assets and performance
- **Authentication**: Optional user accounts for saved searches, annotations

## 13. Technical Challenges & Mitigations

### Challenge: Parsing Legal Language
Legal statutes often describe changes indirectly:
> "Section 106 is amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following..."

**Mitigation**:
- Use Office of Law Revision Counsel's XML format (structured amendments)
- Build parser for common amendment patterns
- Manual review for complex cases
- Display both original bill language AND resulting code change

### Challenge: Historical Data Availability
Pre-1990s laws may lack structured digital format.

**Mitigation**:
- Partner with legal tech companies or academic institutions
- Phased approach: recent history first, backfill over time
- OCR and manual correction for critical historical laws
- Community contribution model for digitization

### Challenge: Effective Dates vs Enactment Dates
Some laws take effect immediately; others have delayed effective dates or phase-in periods.

**Mitigation**:
- Track both enactment and effective dates
- Time travel defaults to effective date
- Show annotation if dates differ significantly

### Challenge: Scale
Full US Code is ~60,000 sections; 100+ years of history = millions of changes.

**Mitigation**:
- Efficient database schema with indexing
- Lazy loading and pagination
- Pre-compute common queries (e.g., "current version")
- CDN for static content

### Challenge: Legal Accuracy
Displaying legal text requires precision; errors could mislead users.

**Mitigation**:
- Canonical source: Official US Code from House OLC
- Regular synchronization with official sources
- Clear disclaimers about unofficial nature
- Feedback mechanism for reporting errors

## 14. Open Questions for Further Discussion

1. **Monetization**: Should this be:
   - Fully free (grant-funded or nonprofit)
   - Freemium (advanced features require subscription)
   - Ad-supported (with ethical ad standards)

2. **Governance**: Who maintains this? Options:
   - Nonprofit organization
   - Open-source community
   - Academic institution
   - Government partnership

3. **Amendments to Bills**: Should we show:
   - Amendments proposed during bill passage as "commits to PR branch"?
   - Failed amendments as "rejected commits"?

4. **Cross-References**: How deeply should we link related sections?
   - Inline links to other sections mentioned?
   - Auto-detect citations and hyperlink them?

5. **International Expansion**: Could this model extend to other countries' legal codes?

6. **Educational Materials**: Should we create:
   - Video tutorials?
   - Guided tours (e.g., "The journey of the ADA")?
   - Curriculum for high school civics classes?

## 16. Conclusion

**The Code We Live By** (CWLB) transforms how citizens understand and engage with federal law. By applying the familiar metaphor of software development to the legislative process, we make the US Code accessible, explorable, and analytically rich.

**Key Differentiators**:
- **Transparency**: See exactly what changed, when, and by whom
- **Historical Depth**: Time-travel through decades of legal evolution
- **Analytical Power**: Answer questions about legislative patterns and productivity
- **Civic Engagement**: Empower citizens to understand the laws that govern them
- **Familiarity**: Leverage intuitive software development metaphors

This platform has the potential to become an essential tool for civic education, journalism, legal research, and public understanding of government.

## Appendix C: Legal & Disclaimers

- This is an unofficial presentation of the US Code
- Official version is at uscode.house.gov
- Not legal advice
- Open data license for all content

## Appendix D: Alternative Repository Structure Mappings

This appendix presents alternative approaches to mapping the US Code structure to repository files. The main specification recommends **Section-as-File** (see Section 1), but these alternatives were considered during design.

### Option 2: Chapter-as-File

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01-Subject-Matter-and-Scope.md
│   ├── Chapter-02-Copyright-Ownership.md
│   └── Chapter-13-Original-Designs.md
├── Title-26-Internal-Revenue-Code/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Directories
- **Chapters** → Files
- **Sections** → Major headings within files
- **Subsections** → Content under headings

**Pros:**
- Fewer total files (~500-1000 vs ~60,000)
- Easier to browse at high level
- Simpler file tree navigation

**Cons:**
- ❌ Very large files (some chapters have 100+ sections)
- ❌ Diffs are harder to read (entire chapter shows as changed even for 1-section amendments)
- ❌ Doesn't match legislative granularity (laws rarely touch whole chapters)
- ❌ Harder to link to specific provisions
- ❌ Section-level history is obscured

**Verdict**: Too coarse-grained for the use case. Would make diffs unwieldy and obscure the section-level changes that are fundamental to legislation.

---

### Option 3: Subsection-as-File

**Structure:**
```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   ├── Chapter-01/
│   │   ├── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights/
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-1-Reproduction.md
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-2-Derivative-Works.md
│   │   │   ├── Subsection-3-Distribution.md
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   └── Section-107-Fair-Use/
│   │       └── ...
```

**Mapping:**
- **Titles** → Top-level directories
- **Chapters** → Directories
- **Sections** → Directories
- **Subsections** → Files
- **Paragraphs** → Content within files

**Pros:**
- Maximum granularity for tracking changes
- Very precise change attribution

**Cons:**
- ❌ Hundreds of thousands of files (overwhelming)
- ❌ Too granular for most use cases
- ❌ Many laws modify entire sections, not subsections
- ❌ Navigation becomes cumbersome
- ❌ Doesn't match typical legislative or legal citation patterns

**Verdict**: Too fine-grained. Creates an overwhelming number of files and doesn't match how laws are typically cited or modified.

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Section-as-File with Subsection Anchors

**Structure:**
Same as recommended Section-as-File approach, but with enhanced deep linking:

```
USC/
├── Title-17-Copyright/
│   └── Chapter-01/
│       └── Section-106-Exclusive-Rights.md
```

**File content with anchors:**
```markdown
# § 106 · Exclusive rights in copyrighted works

Subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner of copyright under this
title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of the following:

## (1) Reproduction {#subsection-1}
to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;

## (2) Derivative Works {#subsection-2}
to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;

...
```

**Enhanced features:**
- URLs can deep-link to subsections: `/Title-17/Chapter-01/Section-106#subsection-2`
- Diffs can highlight subsection-level changes within the file
- UI can show subsection-level change indicators
- Search can index and return subsections as results

**Pros:**
- ✅ Same benefits as Section-as-File
- ✅ Plus: subsection-level precision when needed
- ✅ Progressive disclosure: show section, expand to subsections
- ✅ Flexible for both coarse and fine-grained analysis

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex implementation
- Requires anchor/bookmark parsing

**Verdict**: Strong alternative that could be adopted in Phase 2 for enhanced functionality. Maintains the benefits of Section-as-File while adding subsection-level precision through anchors rather than file structure.
